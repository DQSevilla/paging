# Virtual Memory Simulator

The goal of this project is to implement a simple virtual memory simulator in
C with a focus on comparing the performance of different page replacement
algorithms. In the future, the core simulator will be made more usable through
a web application.

I am doing this assignment to learn and put into practice concepts from
operating systems, systems programming, and web development,into an
interesting learning tool.

Different branches for parts and states of the project, as well as different
"releases" for versions with different feature sets are planned.
